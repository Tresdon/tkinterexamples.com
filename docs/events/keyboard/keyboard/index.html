    ## 
     Keyboard Events
    
    
     Capturing keystrokes inside our `tkinter` program.
    
    
    ### 
     Capture All Key Presses <a href="#all">#</a>
    
    
     We often want to bind a widget to a key on our keyboard being pressed. The general case for this is
      using the `<Key>` event type.
    
    ```import tkinter

root = tkinter.Tk()

def key_handler(event):
    print(event.char, event.keysym, event.keycode)

root.bind("<Key>", key_handler)

root.mainloop()```
    
     This program outputs the following on a few key strokes. Note that for special characters the
      `event.char` attribute is empty.
    
    ```j j 106
h h 104
7 7 55
6 6 54
. period 46
, comma 44
; semicolon 59
  Return 2359309
  Caps_Lock 65536
          Tab 3145737```
    
    ### 
     Capture Specific Key Presses <a href="#specific">#</a>
    
    
     Binding to a specific key requires a very simple event specifier - the character of the key you want
      to bind to. Note that "space" and "<" cannot be used like this. See <a href="#special">special
      keys</a> below. Also note that capitalization matters ("z" is not equal to "Z")
    
    ```root.bind("z", lambda x: print("You pressed lowercase z"))
root.bind("Z", lambda x: print("You pressed capital Z"))
root.bind("3", lambda x: print("You pressed 3"))```
    ### 
     Key Sequences <a href="#sequence">#</a>
    
    
     `tkinter` gives us a very easy way to only call a handler if keys were pressed in a
      specific sequence. This takes advantage of how the `.bind()` method works, requiring a
      sequence of specifiers for the first argument:
    
    ```root.bind("abc", lambda x: print("You pressed abc in that order"))
root.bind("beef", lambda x: print("ooh yummy!"))```
    ### 
     Special Keys <a href="#special">#</a>
    
    
     There are some special keys that have distinct event bindings:
    
    
     - 
      `<Return>` - The return / enter key
     
     - 
      `<Up>, <Down>, <Left>, <Right>` - The arrow keys
     
     - 
      `<space>, <less>` - The space and less than keys, respectively
     
     - 
      `<Shift-Up>, <Alt-Up>, <Control-Up>` - The up key was pressed while
        a modifier key was pressed
     
    
    ### 
     Focus <a href="#focus">#</a>
    
    
     The last thing we need to talk about regarding keyboard events is the "focus" events. These are
      triggered when keyboard focus has been moved to or from the specified widget. This focus is moved by
      using the `focus_set()` method on the widget.
    
    
     - 
      `<FocusIn>` - Keyboard focus was moved to this widget
     
     - 
      `<FocusOut>` - Keyboard focus was moved out of this widget
