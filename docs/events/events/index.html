    ## 
     Events
    
    
     Events in `tkinter` are all the command inputs that can happen inside your application
      such as mouse movements / clicks, keyboard entries, window resizes, widget introduction, the list goes
      on. Generally there are two types of events, those which are built into a widget and those which are
      explicitly bound to a widget.
    
    
    ### 
     Implicit Events <a href="#implicit">#</a>
    
    
     Some widgets have events built into them such as the `Button` widget which takes a
      `command=` argument. When we click the button, the callable in our command parameter will be
      called. Some other widgets with built in event bindings (via `command=`) are:
    
    
     - 
      `Checkbutton - called on selection`
     
     - 
      `Radiobutton - called on selection`
     
     - 
      `Scale - called on update (movement of scale widget)`
     
     - 
      `Scrollbar - called on update (movement of scrollbar)`
     
     - 
      `Spinbox - called on update (new value selected)`
     
    
    
    ### 
     Explicitly-Bound Events <a href="#explicit">#</a>
    
    
     There are many events which can be bound to any widget with the syntax:
      `widget.bind("<Event-Specifier>", callable_handler)`. This causes the specified
      handler to get called whenever the event occurs. Note that we can also bind events to our container
      objects such as `Tk, Frame, & TopLevel`

    #### 
     Binding Options <a href="#binding-options">#</a>
    </h4>
    
     There are multiple ways to bind events to widgets in `tkinter`:
    
    
     - 
      `.bind()` - bind to the specific widget only (instance binding)
     
     - 
      `.bind_class()` - bind to the all widgets of this class (class binding)
     
     - 
      `.bind_all()` - bind across the whole application (application binding)
     
    
    
     Be aware that `.bind_class()` can get in the way of default widget behavior since this is
      how tkinter itself implements default behaviors for widgets. The preferred method is creating a widget
      class that inherits from the base class and configures a bind on instantiation.
    
    ```
class BoundButton(tkinter.Button):
    def __init__(self, master, **kw):
        apply(tkinter.Button.__init__, (self, master), kw)
        self.bind("<Return>", lambda event: print(event))
      ```
    #### 
     Declaring Callables <a href="#callables">#</a>
    </h4>
    
     When we declare callables to act as event handlers we should take note that the triggering event
      will pass an <a href="#event-object">event object</a> into our callable function. This means we should
      define our event handlers with one parameter. Implicit events sometimes have the additional
      argument.
    
    ```
def keyboard_handler(event):
    print(event.char)

def mouse_handler(event):
    print(event.x, event.y)
    print(event.char) # prints ??```
    
     Note that we can also pass callables directly into the `.bind()` function using
      lambdas.
    
    ```
root.bind("k", lambda event: print("k was pressed!"))```
    #### 
     The Event Object <a href="#event-object">#</a>
    </h4>
    
     The event object passed into our event-handlers has many attributes. Some of the commonly used ones
      are:
    
    
     - 
      `widget` - the widget which generated the event
     
     - 
      `type` - the type of event this is (equal to inner text of the event specifier)
     
     - 
      `x, y` - the position of the mouse relative to the bound widget (mouse events
        only)
     
     - 
      `num` - the mouse button pressed (mouse events only)
     
     - 
      `char` - the pressed key as a character literal (keyboard events only)
     
     - 
      `keycode, keysym` - the pressed key as a code or symbol (keyboard events only)
